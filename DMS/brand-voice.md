# RouteFlo Voice Profile

## Voice Summary
Sounds like an operations person talking to another operations person. Direct, practical, no fluff. Understands the reality of managing drivers and routes because it was built by people who've lived it. Doesn't try to impress with jargon or overpromise with hype—just shows you how it works and gets out of the way.

## Core Personality Traits
- **Practical first:** Everything is about what actually works in the real world. No theoretical benefits—only things you'll see Monday morning.
- **Operator empathy:** Understands the chaos of running routes, managing drivers, and keeping customers happy. Doesn't need to explain the problem—acknowledges it and moves to the solution.
- **No-BS direct:** Says what it does, shows how it works. Doesn't hide behind buzzwords or make you sit through a demo to see the product.
- **Quietly confident:** Knows it solves the problem. Doesn't need to oversell. Lets the product speak.

## Tone Spectrum

| Dimension | Position | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Formal ↔ Casual | Casual-professional | Like a vendor you'd actually want to work with |
| Serious ↔ Playful | Mostly serious | Occasional dry humor, but this is a work tool |
| Reserved ↔ Bold | Measured bold | Makes clear claims, doesn't oversell |
| Simple ↔ Sophisticated | Very simple | Plain words for plain-talking operators |
| Warm ↔ Direct | Direct with warmth | Gets to the point but isn't cold |

## Vocabulary

**Words/phrases to USE:**
- "Stops" not "delivery points" — industry language
- "Drivers" not "fleet" — human, not corporate
- "Generate routes" — what the product does
- "Works for you" — customer benefit framing
- "Built for" — specificity signal
- "In seconds" / "in clicks" — speed emphasis
- "One place" — consolidation benefit

**Words/phrases to AVOID:**
- "Optimize" / "leverage" / "synergy" — corporate jargon
- "Revolutionary" / "game-changing" — oversell
- "AI-powered" / "smart" — tech buzzwords (unless showing specific value)
- "Solution" — vague corporate speak
- "Seamless" / "robust" / "scalable" — meaningless modifiers
- "Excited to announce" — generic marketing speak

**Jargon level:** Light to none — speak like the customer speaks

**Profanity:** Never — professional B2B context

## Rhythm & Structure

**Sentences:** Short to medium. Gets to the point. Occasional fragment for emphasis.

**Paragraphs:** Short. 1-3 sentences. White space is a feature.

**Openings:** Lead with the problem or the benefit. No throat-clearing. No "In today's fast-paced world..."

**Formatting:** Clear headers. Bullet points for features. Screenshots over descriptions when possible.

## POV & Address

**First person:** "We" for company, but sparingly. Focus on "you" (the customer).
**Reader address:** "You" — direct, personal
**Relationship stance:** Vendor who respects your time. Not a guru, not a peer, not a consultant—a tool that works.

## Example Phrases

**On-brand (sounds like us):**
- "Your routes shouldn't live in a spreadsheet."
- "Add customers without breaking your routes."
- "Drivers see their stops. You stop getting calls."
- "Built for mat and linen delivery. Not pizza or packages."
- "See it in 15 minutes. Decide if it's for you."

**Off-brand (doesn't sound like us):**
- "Our revolutionary AI-powered platform leverages cutting-edge technology to optimize your logistics operations." — Too corporate, too buzzwordy
- "We're passionate about helping delivery companies succeed!" — Empty, generic
- "Supercharge your fleet management with our robust solution." — Meaningless modifiers, vague
- "Schedule a demo to learn more about how we can help!" — Hides the product, salesy

## Do's and Don'ts

- Show the product (screenshots, videos)
- Use industry terms the way customers use them
- Acknowledge the real pain ("we know, spreadsheets suck")
- Be specific about what the product does
- Let them see it before they talk to sales
- Respect their time (short copy, clear CTAs)

**DON'T:**
- Hide behind marketing speak
- Overpromise ("transform your business!")
- Use buzzwords to sound smart
- Make them dig to understand what it actually does
- Require a demo to see the product
- Talk about "the industry" or "logistics" generically
