                    <p>Floor mat rental companies run tight weekly schedules across hundreds of stops.

RouteFlo's mat rental route software handles complex recurring schedules, tracks mat inventory at each location, and generates routes that respect your established service patterns. Stop losing hours rebuilding routes manually when a driver calls out sick.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is route optimization software?</h3>
                    <p>Route optimization software helps businesses plan the most efficient routes for delivery vehicles. It uses algorithms and real-time data to minimize drive time, avoid traffic delays, reduce fuel costs, and increase the number of stops per day. Modern route optimization software can reduce delivery costs by up to 40% and cut planning time by 95%.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How is RouteFlo different from Routific or OptimoRoute?</h3>
                    <p>RouteFlo is built specifically for recurring service delivery - mat rental, linen services, and uniform delivery. Unlike generic route software designed for one-time deliveries, RouteFlo handles customers with set service days (Mon/Wed/Fri, weekly, bi-weekly) and generates routes that follow your existing service patterns. It includes materials tracking that general delivery software lacks.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How much time does route planning software save?</h3>
                    <p>Route planning software typically reduces manual planning time by 95%. What used to take hours of spreadsheet work can be done in seconds. Operations also see 15-40% reductions in total drive time through optimized routing, saving on fuel costs and allowing more deliveries per day.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How long does it take to set up?</h3>
                    <p>Most operations are up and running within a day. You can import your existing customer list via CSV, set up your drivers, and start generating optimized routes immediately. No special hardware or app store downloads required.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do drivers need a special app?</h3>
                    <p>Drivers access their schedule through a simple web app that works on any smartphone. One tap opens each stop in Google Maps for turn-by-turn navigation. No app store download required - just open a link in the browser.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What industries use route optimization software?</h3>
                    <p>Route optimization software is used across delivery industries including mat rental, linen services, uniform delivery, food distribution, HVAC services, and any business with recurring route-based operations. RouteFlo specializes in textile rental and recurring service delivery.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is recurring route software?</h3>
                    <p>Recurring route software is route optimization built for businesses that visit the same customers on set schedules - daily, weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly. Unlike one-time delivery software (food delivery, package shipping), recurring route software maintains customer service schedules, handles substitutions when drivers are unavailable, and keeps routes consistent so customers see the same driver at the same time. Mat rental, linen services, and uniform delivery operations need recurring route software specifically.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How does mat rental route optimization work?</h3>
                    <p>Mat rental route optimization takes your customer list with their service schedules and generates efficient routes for each service day. The software considers stop locations, time windows, driver availability, and recurring patterns to build routes that minimize drive time while ensuring every customer gets serviced on their scheduled day. RouteFlo also tracks mat inventory at each location so drivers know exactly what to pick up and drop off at every stop.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What's the best route optimization for linen services?</h3>
                    <p>The best route optimization for linen services handles the complexity of recurring deliveries - hotels need fresh linens every day, healthcare facilities have strict schedules, and restaurants have specific delivery windows. Generic route software treats every stop as a one-time event. RouteFlo understands that linen delivery is about maintaining service patterns, not just finding the shortest path. Our linen delivery route planning keeps your operation reliable while maximizing route efficiency.</p>
