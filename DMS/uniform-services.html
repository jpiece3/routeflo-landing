                    <h3>What is uniform delivery route software?</h3>
                    <p>Uniform delivery route software is specialized route optimization designed for workwear rental and uniform service companies. It handles the unique needs of recurring uniform delivery - managing customer service schedules, planning efficient routes, and ensuring consistent service.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How does uniform service route optimization work?</h3>
                    <p>Uniform service route optimization takes your customer list with their service schedules and generates efficient routes for each delivery day. The software considers stop locations, service frequency, driver availability, and recurring patterns to build routes that minimize drive time.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can it handle different service frequencies?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. RouteFlo handles any service frequency - weekly delivery for most industrial accounts, twice-weekly for high-volume customers, or custom schedules. Each customer maintains their own schedule, and the software generates optimized routes automatically.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How is this different from generic route planning software?</h3>
                    <p>Generic route planning software is built for one-time deliveries. Uniform rental is fundamentally different: you visit the same customers on set schedules, maintain route consistency, and need to track recurring patterns. RouteFlo is built specifically for this recurring service model.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How long does it take to set up?</h3>
                    <p>Most uniform service operations are up and running within a day. Import your customer list via CSV, set up service schedules, and start generating optimized routes immediately.</p>
