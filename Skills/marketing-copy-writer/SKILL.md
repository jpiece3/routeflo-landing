# Marketing Copy Writer

When creating marketing copy, follow these proven copywriting principles to maximize engagement and conversions:

## Framework: AIDA

1. **Attention**: Hook the reader immediately
2. **Interest**: Build curiosity and relevance
3. **Desire**: Show benefits and create emotional connection
4. **Action**: Clear, compelling call-to-action

## Copy Structure by Format

### Email Campaigns
- **Subject Line**: 6-10 words, create curiosity or urgency
- **Preview Text**: Complement subject line, don't repeat it
- **Opening**: Personal, relevant hook
- **Body**: Short paragraphs (2-3 lines max), benefits-focused
- **CTA**: One primary action, make it stand out

### Landing Pages
- **Headline**: Clear value proposition (10 words or less)
- **Subheadline**: Expand on promise, address pain point
- **Hero Section**: Big benefit, supporting image
- **Features/Benefits**: Focus on outcomes, not features
- **Social Proof**: Testimonials, stats, logos
- **CTA**: Multiple placements, action-oriented language

### Social Media Posts
- **First Line**: Hook within first 3 words
- **Body**: Conversational tone, break into short lines
- **Value**: Educate, entertain, or inspire
- **CTA**: Tag, link, or ask a question
- **Hashtags**: 3-5 relevant tags (platform-dependent)

### Ad Copy
- **Headline**: Promise + specificity
- **Body**: One key benefit, address objection
- **CTA**: Action verb + benefit ("Get Your Free Trial")
- **Character Limits**: Respect platform constraints

## Core Principles

### Focus on Benefits, Not Features
- ❌ "Our software has advanced analytics"
- ✅ "See exactly which campaigns drive revenue"

### Use Power Words
- Urgency: Now, Today, Limited, Exclusive
- Value: Free, Proven, Guaranteed, Results
- Emotion: Transform, Discover, Unlock, Master

### Write Scannable Copy
- Use bullet points for lists
- Bold key phrases
- Short paragraphs (mobile-friendly)
- Subheadings every 2-3 paragraphs

### Address Objections
- Price: Show ROI or value
- Trust: Include social proof
- Complexity: Emphasize ease
- Time: Highlight quick results

### Create Urgency (Ethically)
- Limited-time offers with real deadlines
- Scarcity (limited spots, stock)
- Seasonal relevance
- FOMO (what they'll miss)

## Voice and Tone Guidelines

**Professional Industries** (B2B, Finance, Healthcare):
- Authoritative but approachable
- Data-driven language
- Trust-building terminology

**Consumer Brands** (E-commerce, Lifestyle):
- Conversational and friendly
- Benefit-focused
- Emotionally resonant

**Tech/Startups**:
- Clear and jargon-free
- Innovation-focused
- Future-oriented

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing copy, verify:
- [ ] Clear value proposition in first 5 seconds
- [ ] Benefits outweigh features (3:1 ratio)
- [ ] One primary CTA (not multiple competing actions)
- [ ] Active voice (not passive)
- [ ] Specific numbers (not vague claims)
- [ ] Reads naturally out loud
- [ ] Mobile-friendly formatting
- [ ] Addresses target audience pain points

## Examples

### Bad vs. Good Email Subject Lines

❌ "Newsletter - June 2024"
✅ "3 quick wins to boost your conversion rate"

❌ "Check out our new features"
✅ "You asked for it: Dark mode is here"

### Bad vs. Good CTAs

❌ "Click here"
✅ "Get my free template"

❌ "Submit"
✅ "Start my 14-day trial"

### Bad vs. Good Headlines

❌ "We offer marketing automation tools"
✅ "Send the right message at the perfect time—automatically"

❌ "Advanced features for professionals"
✅ "Cut your email workload in half without losing a single lead"
