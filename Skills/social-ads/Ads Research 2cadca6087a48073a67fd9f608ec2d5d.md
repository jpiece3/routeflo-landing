1. Creative is king. The most important thing you can spend time on developing is your creative. Diverse creative is best, especially in the beginning when you don't know what works for you. So, create single images, carousels, and videos. Test to see which works best for your audience. You will always need to make new creative, so this skill will develop over time. Dont put any text in your images, text doesn't go in the graphics it goes in the headline and descriptions of your ad.
2. The second most important part is your conversion location. This could be your website, but if your website is not good, use instant forms. Instant forms are forms on the FB or IG platform, so you don't have to take the customer off the platform. Instant forms are great for capturing names, emails, and phone numbers. I still use Instant forms for mature advertisers. The point is that you need a good place for customers to convert.
3. Now that you have your graphics picked out and you know where you wanna send them, it is time to create a campaign. The point of a campaign is to pick an objective. In your case, that will lead. Next, you mess with the ad set. The primary function of an ad set is to dictate the audience. Use advantage+ targeting. This type of targeting will find your customers for you. You feed the machine with cash and creative and it will slowly find your ideal lead over time.
4. Budget. Spend enough to get one conversion per day. So you won't know what that is at first. I would start at 10/-30 per day and then figure out how much it costs to get one lead. Once you know that, spend as much as you want, but at least get one lead per day so the machine can keep learning. This is to understand your minimum, if you have more spend it, you will learn quicker.
5. Launch and active management. Don't turn off your campaign after one day if it is not working. Advantage+ targeting will get better after it exits the learning phase. i.e., once your campaign gets 50 conversions, you will really know if your campaign is working or not.
6. YouTube. Go to YT and look for "your industry" Facebook ads. Find someone's strategy that's current and reputable and use it as a starting point.
7. Hire a consultant. It's like YT but 10x faster and more consistent.
8. Take a course. A lot of crap out there. Thats why speaking to someone live on a call is great, cause you can snif there BS if needed. There are some good courses out there, though.
9. Understand that Facebook ads is a skill that needs to be learned. It took most of us years to get really good. You can learn faster with a coach. Some people want to learn just to have good conversations with the person they outsource their marketing to. Some people want to learn enough to manage paid campaigns themselves. Find what works for you.
