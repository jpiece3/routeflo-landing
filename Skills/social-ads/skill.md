# Social Ads

Most businesses waste money on social ads because they boost posts randomly or create pretty ads that don't convert. This skill builds campaigns that actually work—based on proven frameworks and real performance data.

**NEW: Integrates with ai-creative-strategist** to generate multiple visual concept directions with AI-powered previews, turning your campaigns into repeatable content systems.

---

## The core job

Create **complete social ad campaigns** ready to launch in Meta Ads Manager.

Each campaign includes:
- Strategic foundation (objective, offer, targeting)
- Ad copy (primary text, headline, description)
- Creative direction (specific visual guidance)
- Testing plan (variables to test, success metrics)
- Optimization roadmap (what to watch, when to scale)

**Output format:** A campaign brief containing all components needed to launch, test, and scale profitable ads.

---

## The fundamental principle

**Goal > Audience > Creative** (in that order, always)

Most people obsess over making ads look good. That's backwards.

The hierarchy that determines success:
1. **Clear goal** - What action do you want? (message, call, purchase, form fill)
2. **Right audience** - Who has this problem right now?
3. **Aligned offer** - What's the specific solution + timeline?
4. **Proof** - Why should they believe you can deliver?
5. **Creative** - Visual that supports all of the above

**"Your creative will not save you."** Strategy first, aesthetics second.

---

## The alignment formula

Successful ads require three things to align perfectly:

| Element | What it means | Example |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| **Clear Problem** | Specific pain point they have RIGHT NOW | "Branches over your roof threatening damage" |
| **Relevant Offer** | Direct solution with clear timeline | "Trim, clean, haul in 24 hours. Free quote in 30 seconds." |
| **Right Person/Timing** | Targeted audience in buying mode | Homeowners 30-65+ in specific area with trees |

**"If you hit that combo, game over. If you miss one, you're burning money. If you miss two, you're burning a lot of money."**

---

## When to use this skill

Use social-ads when:
- Launching a new product or service campaign
- Testing different offers or angles
- Scaling existing profitable ads with new creative
- Creating retargeting or nurture campaigns
- Need complete campaign structure (not just copy)

Don't use for:
- Organic social posts (use other content skills)
- Twitter/LinkedIn/TikTok ads (different platforms, different mechanics)
- Brand awareness campaigns without conversion goals

---

## Core campaign types

### 1. Messages Campaign (Highest Intent)
**Use when:** You want conversations, not form fills. Works for local services, high-ticket, consultations.

**Why it works:** Easiest action, instant feedback, highest intent.

**Structure:**
- Objective: Messages
- Placement: Facebook + Instagram feeds
- CTA: "Send Message" or "Get Quote"
- Budget: Start $10-30/day

**Benchmarks:**
- Cost per message: $2-$6 (local services)
- CTR: 1%+ is good
- Response time: Under 15 minutes dramatically improves conversion

### 2. Leads Campaign (Form Capture)
**Use when:** Collecting emails/phones for follow-up. Works for webinars, downloads, multi-step sales.

**Why it works:** No website needed, forms stay on platform (less friction).

**Structure:**
- Objective: Leads
- Use Instant Forms
- Pre-fill as much as possible (name, email)
- Budget: Start $10-30/day

**Benchmarks:**
- Cost per lead: Varies widely by industry
- Form completion rate: 30%+ is solid
- Follow-up speed: Under 5 minutes 10x's conversion

### 3. Conversions Campaign (E-commerce/Sales)
**Use when:** Driving purchases on your website. Requires good landing page + pixel tracking.

**Structure:**
- Objective: Conversions
- Event: Purchase (or Add to Cart for retargeting)
- Pixel must be installed and firing
- Budget: Enough for 1 conversion/day minimum

**Benchmarks:**
- ROAS: 2-4x is profitable for most
- CPC: Under $2 general, under $20 for high-ticket
- 50 conversions to exit learning phase

---

## The 5-question ad foundation

Before writing any ad, answer these:

1. **Who is this ad for?** (Be specific—not "homeowners" but "homeowners 30-65 in McKinney with large trees and disposable income")

2. **What problem do they have RIGHT NOW?** (Not general problem—specific, urgent pain)

3. **What solution am I offering them?** (Include timeline—"in 24 hours" not "soon")

4. **What proof do I have I can deliver?** (Before/after, testimonial, years in business, guarantee)

5. **What is the ONE action I want them to take?** (Message, call, click, sign up—pick one)

If you can't answer all five clearly, the ad will be vague and won't convert.

---

## Ad copy framework

### Primary text (the main caption)

**Structure:**
1. **Hook** (1-2 sentences) - Call out the specific problem or person
2. **Agitate or promise** (1-2 sentences) - Why it matters or what's possible
3. **Offer** (1-2 sentences) - What you're selling + timeline
4. **Proof** (1 sentence) - Why believe you
5. **CTA** (1 sentence) - What to do next

**Length:** 75-150 words max. **"You don't need to be cute, you need to be clear."**

**Example (tree trimming service):**
```
Branches over your roof? One bad storm and you're looking at thousands in damage.

We'll trim, clean, and haul everything away in 24 hours. No mess, no hassle, no waiting around for weeks.

Get a free quote in 30 seconds. No pressure, just fast work.

Serving McKinney homeowners since 2015. Message us now.
```

### Headline (the bold text)

**Job:** Reinforce the main benefit or create urgency.

**Length:** 5-10 words max.

**Examples:**
- "Tree Trimming in 24 Hours"
- "Free Quote in 30 Seconds"
- "Same-Day HVAC Repair - No Overtime Charges"
- "Book Your Free Home Audit Today"

### Description (supporting text under headline)

**Job:** Add specifics—area served, price range, next step.

**Length:** 3-8 words.

**Examples:**
- "Serving McKinney - Message for Quote"
- "$99 Diagnostic Special This Week Only"
- "No Credit Card Required to Start"

## Creative direction (visual strategy)

**The truth:** Simple beats fancy. Phone photo beats stock photo. Real beats polished.

### Creative generation modes:

You have two options for generating ad creatives:

#### Option A: DIY Creative Direction (Quick)
Use this when you know what visuals to shoot/create yourself.

**What works (priority order):**

1. **Before/After shots** (especially for transformation services)
   - Real photos, not mockups
   - Clear difference visible
   - Label which is which

2. **Selfie/person** (builds trust for service businesses)
   - You in work uniform/environment
   - Smiling, approachable
   - Not corporate headshot

3. **Product in use** (e-commerce)
   - Show it being used, not just sitting
   - Lifestyle context
   - Close enough to see details

4. **Customer testimonial screenshot** (proof)
   - Real text message or review
   - Include name if possible
   - Highlight specific result

5. **Simple text graphic** (when nothing else fits)
   - Big text, minimal design
   - One message only
   - High contrast colors

**What doesn't work:**
- Stock photos (people can smell them)
- Logos as the main visual
- Text-heavy graphics
- Abstract imagery
- Corporate/polished studio shots

#### Option B: AI Creative Strategist (Advanced)
**Use the ai-creative-strategist skill to generate visual concepts and previews.**

When you want:
- Multiple visual style directions to test
- AI-generated creative previews
- Strategic visual thinking beyond "take a photo"
- Content systems (not just one-off ads)
- Anti-generic, distinctive aesthetics

**How to invoke:**
```
"Use ai-creative-strategist to generate 3-4 visual directions for this ad campaign:
[Campaign details, offer, target audience, angle]"
```

The creative strategist will:
1. Generate 3-4 distinctly different visual styles
2. Create actual preview images using Nano Banana Pro
3. Explain what each direction communicates
4. Rate risk level and differentiation
5. Suggest which to test first

**Example output from creative strategist:**
```markdown
### Direction A: Before/After Transformation
[Generated preview image]
- **Vibe:** Proof-based, dramatic, real
- **Says:** "We deliver visible results"
- **Best for:** Local services, transformations
- **Risk:** Low

### Direction B: Selfie Behind-the-Scenes
[Generated preview image]
- **Vibe:** Authentic, approachable, trustworthy
- **Says:** "Real person, not a corporation"
- **Best for:** Service businesses, local
- **Risk:** Low

### Direction C: Retro Tech Aesthetic
[Generated preview image]
- **Vibe:** Nostalgic, playful, pattern interrupt
- **Says:** "We're different from boring competitors"
- **Best for:** Younger audiences, standing out
- **Risk:** Medium (may confuse older demos)

### Direction D: Bold Text Graphic
[Generated preview image]
- **Vibe:** Direct, urgent, scroll-stopping
- **Says:** "Pay attention to this offer"
- **Best for:** Urgency-based offers
- **Risk:** Medium (can look salesy)
```

**When to use creative strategist:**
- New campaigns that need standout creative
- Testing multiple visual angles against each other
- Building content systems (10+ variations from one concept)
- Want professional-level creative thinking

**When to skip:**
- You already know what photo/video to use
- Quick test with existing assets
- Retargeting with proven creative

**Critical rule (both options):** **NO TEXT IN THE IMAGE.** Text goes in headline/description, not baked into graphics. (Facebook penalizes text-heavy images)

---

## Targeting strategy

### Default approach: Advantage+ Audience

**Why:** Let Facebook's algorithm find your customers. It's better at this than manual targeting.

**How:**
1. Set location (radius or specific areas)
2. Set age range (if relevant to offer)
3. Add 2-3 broad interests MAX (or none)
4. Let Facebook optimize from there

**"Feed the machine with cash and creative and it will slowly find your ideal lead over time."**

### When to use detailed targeting:

Only when you have VERY specific audiences:
- Retargeting (people who engaged but didn't convert)
- Lookalike audiences (based on customer list)
- Competitors' audiences (for local services)
- Interest stacking for niche B2B

**Most common mistake:** Over-targeting (shrinking audience too small, preventing learning)

**Good audience size:** 50K-500K for cold traffic

---

## Budget and bidding

### Starting budget framework:

**Goal:** Spend enough to get **1 conversion per day minimum.**

| Daily Spend | Strategy | What to expect |
|-------------|----------|----------------|
| $10-20 | Test and learn | 7-day learning phase, gather initial data |
| $20-50 | Begin optimization | Enough data to see patterns |
| $50-100 | Scale winners | Multiple conversions/day |
| $100-250 | Expand + retarget | Layer in nurture campaigns |
| $250-500 | Diversify creative | Rotate new creative weekly |

**Starting recommendation:** $10-30/day until you find what works. Then scale slowly (20% increases weekly).

**Critical learning phase rule:** Need 50 conversions before Facebook really knows what's working.

---

## Launch and active management

### The 72-hour rule

**"Don't touch your ad for 72 hours."**

Why? Facebook needs time to learn. Constant tweaking resets the algorithm.

What to do in first 72 hours:
- Watch metrics (don't act on them yet)
- Respond to messages/leads FAST
- Resist urge to pause/edit

What to watch after 72 hours:
- CTR under 0.5%? Test new creative
- CPC too high? Test new audience
- No conversions? Check your conversion location (landing page/form)

### The testing hierarchy

**Only test one variable at a time.**

Priority order:
1. **Creative** (image/video) - Highest impact, test first
2. **Primary text** - Different hooks/angles
3. **Headline** - Benefit variations
4. **Audience** - Different targeting
5. **Placement** - Feed vs Stories vs Reels
6. **Objective** - Messages vs Leads vs Conversions

**Testing method:**
- Duplicate ad set
- Change ONE thing
- Run both simultaneously
- Let each get 100-200 impressions minimum
- Kill the loser, scale the winner

---

## Scaling framework

### When to scale:

✅ Ad is profitable (hitting target CPA/ROAS)
✅ Consistent performance for 7+ days
✅ Not experiencing fatigue (performance declining)

### How to scale:

**Option 1: Vertical scaling** (increase budget on winning ad set)
- Increase by 20% every 3-5 days
- Don't double overnight (resets learning)
- Watch for performance drop

**Option 2: Horizontal scaling** (duplicate winners)
- Duplicate winning ad set
- Test new audience segment
- Keep original running

**Option 3: Creative refresh** (rotate new visuals)
- New ads every 2-3 weeks
- Keep same targeting/copy
- Prevent creative fatigue

**"Scale slowly and only scale profitable ads."**

---

## Performance benchmarks

### What "good" looks like (local services):

| Metric | Good | Great | Industry context |
|--------|------|-------|-----------------|
| CTR | 1%+ | 2%+ | General local services |
| CPC | Under $2 | Under $1 | Higher for legal/finance |
| Cost/Message | $2-6 | Under $3 | Messages objective |
| CPM | $10-25 | Under $15 | Baseline awareness cost |
| Conversion Rate | 3-5% | 8%+ | Landing page/form |

### What "good" looks like (e-commerce):

| Metric | Good | Great | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|-------|
| ROAS | 2-4x | 5x+ | Revenue / ad spend |
| CPC | Under $1.50 | Under $0.75 | Click cost |
| Add to Cart | 2-5% | 8%+ | Of visitors |
| Purchase Rate | 1-2% | 3%+ | Of visitors |

**"If you're profitable, you're winning."** Don't obsess over perfect metrics.

---

## Advanced tactics

### 1. Meta Ads Library competitive research

**How:** Go to Meta Ads Library → Search competitor → Filter by "Active ads"

**What to look for:**
- If they're running it NOW, it's probably working
- Copy their structure (not word-for-word)
- See what creative they use
- Notice their offers

**"If they're spending money on it right now and they seem like a sophisticated competitor, it's probably working."**

### 2. Comment trap method (social proof)

**Problem:** Cold ads have no engagement, look unpopular.

**Solution:**
1. Run Post Engagement campaign to warm audience
2. Let it accumulate likes/comments
3. Copy Post ID
4. Use same post in cold campaigns
5. Now cold traffic sees social proof

**Result:** Ads with engagement convert better (trust signals).

### 3. Multi-layer funnel

Don't just run one ad. Build layers:

**Layer 1: Cold traffic ad**
- Messages/Leads objective
- Broad audience
- $20-100/day

**Layer 2: Retargeting ad**
- Target: People who engaged but didn't convert
- Different offer or angle
- $3-10/day

**Layer 3: Nurture ad**
- Target: People 5-7 days after engaging
- Testimonials, case studies, education
- $5-15/day

**"This is how you build a system, not just run random ads."**

---

## Creative refresh schedule

**Why:** Ads fatigue. Same creative to same people = declining performance.

**When to refresh:**
- Performance drops 20%+ from baseline
- Frequency hits 3+ (same person seeing it 3 times)
- Every 2-3 weeks for active campaigns

**What to refresh:**
- New photos/videos (same message, different visual)
- Same photo, different copy angle
- Seasonal variations

**What NOT to change:** The core offer/targeting if it's working. Refresh creative, not strategy.

---

## Integration with brand-voice

**For consistent messaging across campaigns:**

If you've created a voice profile using the brand-voice skill, attach it when using social-ads.

**Example:**
"Create social ads for [offer]. Use the attached brand-voice profile to match tone, vocabulary, and personality."

**Result:** Ads that sound like YOU, not generic marketing copy.

**The principle:** "People buy from people, not from corporations."

---

## Common mistakes to avoid

❌ **Boosting posts without strategy** - Wastes money, no targeting control
❌ **Text in images** - Facebook penalizes it
❌ **Vague offers** - "Call us for more info" doesn't convert
❌ **No proof** - Why should they trust you?
❌ **Over-targeting** - Audience too small for Facebook to learn
❌ **Constant tweaking** - Resets the algorithm
❌ **Scaling too fast** - Doubles budget overnight kills performance
❌ **Ignoring messages** - Fast response is critical
❌ **No testing plan** - Running one ad and hoping

---

## The fundamental truth

**"The tighter the offer, the better the ad will perform."**

Vague = expensive. Specific = profitable.

- Not "tree service" → "Tree trimming in 24 hours"
- Not "HVAC repair" → "Same-day AC fix, no overtime charges"
- Not "get in shape" → "Lose 10 lbs in 30 days with meal plan included"

**"The difference between an ad that makes you $200 and an ad that makes you $20,000 is execution and repetition."**

This skill gives you the execution framework. You provide the repetition.

---

## Example: Using social-ads + ai-creative-strategist together

**User request:**
"Create a Facebook ad campaign for my tree trimming service. I want something that stands out from all the boring competitors."

**Step 1: Run social-ads**
```
/social-ads

Create a messages campaign for tree trimming service in McKinney, Texas.
Target: homeowners 30-65 with large trees.
Offer: Free quote in 30 seconds, work done in 24 hours.
```

**Output from social-ads:**
- Complete campaign structure (objective, targeting, budget)
- High-converting ad copy following the framework
- DIY creative guidance (before/after photos, selfie options)
- Testing plan and optimization roadmap

**Step 2: Run ai-creative-strategist for advanced visuals**
```
/ai-creative-strategist

Generate 3-4 visual directions for this tree trimming ad campaign:
- Target: McKinney homeowners 30-65
- Offer: Tree trimming in 24 hours, free quote in 30 seconds
- Goal: Stand out from boring competitor ads
- Vibe: Trustworthy but not corporate, local service
```

**Output from creative strategist:**
- Direction A: Before/After Transformation (preview image)
- Direction B: Selfie with truck/equipment (preview image)
- Direction C: Bold Typography on Tree Background (preview image)
- Direction D: Retro "Emergency Tree Service" Badge Design (preview image)

**Step 3: Test and systematize**
Launch all 4 creative directions with same copy. After 7 days, Direction C (Bold Typography) wins with:
- 2.1% CTR
- $3.21 cost per message
- Most engagement from 35-50 age group

**Step 4: Build content system with creative strategist**
```
/ai-creative-strategist

Direction C won! Build a content system from these principles:
- Bold typography style
- Tree/nature backgrounds
- Direct messaging
- High contrast

Create 10 variations for different services/seasons.
```

**Result:**
- 10+ ad variations using same winning style
- Different messages: "Branches over your roof?", "Storm damage?", "Tree blocking sun?"
- Different seasons: "Winter storm prep", "Spring cleanup", "Fall leaf removal"
- Same proven visual system = consistent performance

**This is the power of integrating social-ads + ai-creative-strategist.**

You don't just get one ad. You get a system that prints money.
