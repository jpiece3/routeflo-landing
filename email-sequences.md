**Preview:** 10 questions. 2 minutes. Find what's costing you time.
**CTA:** Download checklist + reply with score

---

Here's your Route Planning Audit Checklist: [DOWNLOAD LINK]

10 questions. Takes about 2 minutes.

Each "no" is a gap that's probably costing you hours every week. Most operators score 3-5 out of 10 on the first pass.

Here's how to use it:

1. Go through each question honestly
2. Count your "yes" answers
3. Look at the gaps—those are your priorities

After you finish, hit reply and tell me your score. I read every response, and I'm curious where most operations get stuck.

Over the next week, I'll send you a few emails about what we've learned from mat and linen operations that made the switch from spreadsheets to software. Practical stuff, no fluff.

### Email 2: Connection / Story

**Send:** Day 2
**Subject:** The 6am phone call
**Preview:** "Where am I supposed to go next?"
**CTA:** None (relationship building)

---

Quick story:

We talked to an operations manager last month. He'd been running routes for 12 years.

Every morning at 6am, without fail, his phone would ring. One of his drivers: "Where am I supposed to go next?"

He'd pull out his spreadsheet—the one only he really understood—and walk them through the route. Again.

When we asked what his morning looked like, he laughed. "I don't have mornings. I have phone calls."

Sound familiar?

The checklist you downloaded? It came from conversations like his. Every question represents something we've seen trip up operations that run on spreadsheets, notebooks, or someone's memory.

Tomorrow I'll share what we've found is usually the biggest gap—and it's not what most people expect.

### Email 3: Value / Insight

**Send:** Day 4
**Subject:** The gap most operations miss
**Preview:** It's not route optimization. It's something simpler.
**CTA:** None (value delivery)

---

When we ask operators what's broken about their routing, they usually say "route optimization" or "efficiency."

But that's rarely the real problem.

The real problem? **No single source of truth.**

- Customer service days are in a spreadsheet
- Route assignments are on paper (or in someone's head)
- Driver schedules are in a different system
- Nobody's sure if the spreadsheet is up to date

When there's no single source of truth, everything takes longer. Every change requires updating three places. Every question requires hunting down the answer.

Route optimization matters. But it's not worth much if the underlying data is scattered across five different places.

Question: Where does your route information actually live right now? If the answer is "multiple places," that's usually where the real time gets lost.

— The RouteFlo Team

P.S. Look at question #3 and #7 on the checklist. Those are the "source of truth" questions.

### Email 4: Bridge / What's Possible

**Send:** Day 6
**Subject:** What changes when routing takes 2 minutes
**Preview:** You get your mornings back.
**CTA:** Soft mention of demo

---

Imagine this:

It's Monday morning. You need routes for the week.

Instead of pulling up the spreadsheet, cross-referencing the service days, figuring out which driver gets which stops, and hoping you didn't miss anything—

You open RouteFlo. Select Monday. Click "Generate Routes."

Done. Two minutes.

Your drivers get their schedules on their phones. With Google Maps built in. No phone calls asking "where do I go next?"

That's what changes when routing takes 2 minutes instead of 2 hours.

We built RouteFlo specifically for mat and linen operations—where customers have recurring service days and routes need to be generated week after week.

If you want to see how it works, we do 15-minute demos. No pressure, no long sales pitch. Just a walkthrough of how the system handles stops, routes, and driver schedules.

[Book a 15-minute demo]

Or don't. Either way, I'll send one more email on Thursday with a few resources that might help.

### Email 5: Direct CTA

**Send:** Day 8
**Subject:** Quick question about your routes
**Preview:** Then I'll stop filling up your inbox.
**CTA:** Demo request

---

Last email in this sequence.

Quick question: Did you finish the checklist?

If you scored 7+: You're in good shape. Keep doing what you're doing.

If you scored under 7: There's probably a gap worth fixing. And it might be worth 15 minutes to see if RouteFlo fits.

Here's what a demo covers:

- How to add your stops and set service days
- How route generation works (it's fast)
- What drivers see on their end
- How the calendar and map views help you plan

No pressure. If it's not a fit, I'll tell you. We'd rather you find the right solution than waste time on the wrong one.

[Book a 15-minute demo]

If now's not the right time, no worries. We'll be here when you're ready.

— The RouteFlo Team

P.S. If you have questions I can answer over email, just hit reply. Happy to help either way.

## Notes for Implementation

**Email service:** Any standard email platform works (ConvertKit, Mailchimp, ActiveCampaign, etc.)

**Personalization:** Post-demo emails should be personalized based on the actual conversation. Use templates as starting points.

**Timing:** B2B emails work best Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11am recipient time.

**Tracking:** Track open rates, click rates, and demo booking rate to optimize over time.
