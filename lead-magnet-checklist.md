# The 10-Point Route Audit
### Find What's Costing You Hours Every Week

---

**Instructions:** Answer each question honestly. Each "No" is a gap that's probably costing you time. Most operations score 3-5 on the first pass.

---

## The Checklist

### 1. Single Source of Truth
**Do all your customer stops, service days, and route assignments live in ONE place?**

☐ Yes ☐ No

*If no: You're probably updating multiple spreadsheets, cross-referencing paper notes, or keeping critical info in someone's head. Every change takes longer than it should.*

---

### 2. Service Day Clarity
**Can you instantly see which customers need service on any given day?**

☐ Yes ☐ No

*If no: You're manually filtering spreadsheets or flipping through pages to figure out Monday's stops vs. Wednesday's stops. That's time you shouldn't be spending.*

---

### 3. Route Generation Speed
**Can you generate a full day's routes for all drivers in under 5 minutes?**

☐ Yes ☐ No

*If no: You're spending mornings playing dispatcher instead of running your operation. Route planning shouldn't take hours.*

---

### 4. Driver Independence
**Can your drivers start their day without calling you to ask where to go?**

☐ Yes ☐ No

*If no: You're the bottleneck. Every "where do I go next?" call is time stolen from both of you.*

---

### 5. New Customer Setup
**Can you add a new customer without manually redoing existing routes?**

☐ Yes ☐ No

*If no: Growth creates chaos. New customers should slot into existing routes, not break them.*

---

### 6. Visual Route Overview
**Can you see all your routes on a map to check coverage and efficiency?**

☐ Yes ☐ No

*If no: You might have drivers crossing paths or missing obvious geographic clusters. Hard to optimize what you can't see.*

---

### 7. Schedule Visibility
**Can you see which drivers are scheduled for which days at a glance?**

☐ Yes ☐ No

*If no: Planning time off, handling sick days, or balancing workloads becomes guesswork.*

---

### 8. Driver Has Navigation
**Do your drivers have their route with turn-by-turn directions on their phone?**

☐ Yes ☐ No

*If no: Drivers are either using their own phones to manually enter addresses or calling you for directions. Both waste time.*

---

### 9. Change Management
**When a customer changes service days, can you update it in one place?**

☐ Yes ☐ No

*If no: One change means updating the spreadsheet, telling the driver, maybe updating another list. Things fall through.*

---

### 10. Backup Plan
**If you were out sick tomorrow, could someone else generate routes?**

☐ Yes ☐ No

*If no: Your routing knowledge is a single point of failure. That's a risk to the business.*

## Score Yourself

**Count your "Yes" answers:**

| Score | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| **8-10** | Your system is solid. You're ahead of most operations. |
| **5-7** | You've got the basics, but there are gaps costing you time. |
| **3-4** | You're working harder than you need to. Significant time being lost. |
| **0-2** | Your routing system is held together with duct tape. Time for a change. |

---

## What Each Gap Costs You

| Gap | Typical Time Lost |
|-----|-------------------|
| No single source of truth | 2-3 hours/week chasing information |
| Manual route generation | 5-10 hours/week on planning |
| Driver phone calls | 30-60 min/day of interruptions |
| No visual overview | Inefficient routes, extra fuel |
| Change management chaos | 1-2 hours/week fixing mistakes |

**Most operations with scores under 5 are losing 10+ hours per week on routing.**

That's 500+ hours per year. What would you do with that time back?
