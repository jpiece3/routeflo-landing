# Meta Ads Generator

Generate 4 high-converting Meta (Facebook/Instagram) ad variations with different psychological angles, formatted for direct copy-paste into Meta Ads Manager.

## What This Skill Does

Creates complete ad copy for Meta campaigns with:
- 4 distinct variations testing different angles
- Proper formatting for Meta's 3-field structure
- Character limit compliance
- Strategic messaging variety for A/B testing

## When to Use This Skill

- Creating new Meta ad campaigns for lead magnets, products, or services
- Need multiple angles to test which resonates with your audience
- Want copy ready to paste directly into Meta Ads Manager
- Building campaigns targeting Facebook and Instagram feeds

## How It Works

### Step 1: Discovery Questions

Answer these 5 questions about your offer:

1. **What are you selling/giving away?** (product, service, lead magnet, etc.)
2. **Who is your target audience?** (specific as possible - demographics, pain points, desires)
3. **What's the main promise/benefit?** (what do they get or achieve?)
4. **What pain points does this solve?** (list 3-5 specific frustrations)
5. **What makes your approach unique?** (your positioning, personality, or methodology)

### Step 2: Ad Generation

The AI will create 4 ad variations, each testing a different psychological angle:

**Variation #1: Personality/Positioning Angle**
- Leads with your unique voice or contrarian stance
- Builds trust through authenticity and relatability
- Example: "I'm not a guru, I'm a handyman"

**Variation #2: Pain/Money Angle**
- Hits the financial or time-waste pain point hard
- Quantifies the problem they're facing
- Example: "Stop paying $200/hr for things AI can do free"

**Variation #3: Contrarian/Anti-Guru Angle**
- Positions against the competition or industry norms
- Appeals to skeptics and people burned before
- Example: "No webinars. No upsells. Just tools that work."

**Variation #4: Curiosity/Specificity Angle**
- Lists specific deliverables or components
- Creates curiosity through detail and clarity
- Example: "Inside: Tool #1... Tool #2... Tool #3..."

### Step 3: Output Format

Each variation includes:

**Primary Text:**
- Main ad copy (appears above image)
- First 125 characters must hook attention (shows before "See More")
- 3-4 short paragraphs max
- Uses bullet points (→) for scannability

**Headline:**
- 40 character limit (strictly enforced)
- Punchy, benefit-driven
- Includes key promise

**Description:**
- 30 character limit (optional but recommended)
- Supporting detail or urgency element

│ → Most important selling space      │
│ → First 125 chars show by default   │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤

├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ HEADLINE (40 char max)              │

└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Best Practices Built Into Output

✅ **First 125 characters are front-loaded** - Hook is strong before "See More"
✅ **Conversational tone** - Reads like a human, not a corporate ad
✅ **Specific numbers** - Uses concrete figures ($200/hr, 10 hours/week, 6 tools)
✅ **Bullet points with →** - Increases scannability
✅ **Short paragraphs** - Mobile-friendly reading
✅ **Clear CTA** - Tells them exactly what to do next
✅ **Character limits enforced** - Headlines ≤40, Descriptions ≤30

2. **Pair each ad** with an appropriate image (product shot, lifestyle, graphic, etc.)

- Designed for **cold traffic** (people who don't know you yet)
- Assumes **direct response** goal (lead gen or sales), not brand awareness
- Copy style is **casual, direct, benefit-focused** - adjust tone if needed for your brand
- Works best when you have a **clear offer** with tangible value
